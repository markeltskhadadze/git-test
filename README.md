# Chat-Nuxt-GPT

Chat-Nuxt-GPT is a simple web application created using the Nuxt.js framework to build a chat interface utilizing the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model for automatically generating responses to user messages.

## Description

This project allows users to interact with a virtual chatbot that uses the GPT model to analyze messages and generate responses. Users can send text messages through the chat interface and then receive responses from the chatbot based on the trained GPT model.

## Features

- Sending text messages through the chat interface
- Generating responses to user messages using the GPT model
- Visual representation of the chat interface using the Nuxt.js framework

## Installation and Usage

1. Install project dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the project by running `npm run dev`.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to begin using the chat interface.

## System Requirements

- Node.js version 18
- npm for managing project dependencies

## Technologies

- Nuxt.js - a framework for building universal Vue.js applications
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) - a text generation model developed by OpenAI
- Vue.js - a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
